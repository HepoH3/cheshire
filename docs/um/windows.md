# Using the Cheshire Repository on Windows via WSL2

This guide describes how to work with the [Cheshire](https://github.com/pulp-platform/cheshire) repository in a Windows environment.

While it is technically possible to install all required dependencies (Bender, CMake, Python and its packages, GCC, and a RISC-V cross-compiler) natively on Windows, dependency build scripts are likely to fail. The main reasons include:

- **Path incompatibility**: Windows uses backslashes (`\`) in paths, which are interpreted as escape characters in many scripts.
- **Missing Unix utilities**: The build scripts rely on utilities not present in the Windows environment.

To resolve these issues, the scripts are executed within the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)** environment. Using WSL2 avoids problems caused by the wide variety of Windows terminals (cmd, PowerShell, MSYS, Cygwin, Git Bash, etc.), each with its own path interpretation and limitations. Furthermore, WSL2 allows running host-side programs such as **Vivado** or **QuestaSim**, which is leveraged in this setup.

Confirmed working scenarios include:

- Firmware synthesis (e.g., for target `chs-xilinx-vcu128`)
- Simulation using QuestaSim

---

## 1. Prerequisites

### Install WSL2

Follow Microsoft's official guide to set up WSL2: [How to install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

### Install Dependencies
Once WSL2 is installed, open a WSL terminal and follow the [Cheshire Getting Started guide](https://pulp-platform.github.io/cheshire/gs/#dependencies) to install dependencies.

### Install Required EDA Tools on Windows

- For **synthesis**: Install **Vivado** on the Windows host.
- For **simulation**: Install **QuestaSim** (note that **VCS** is not available for Windows).

## 2. Adjust WSL Mount Points

By default, WSL mounts Windows drives under `/mnt/`. This creates inconsistencies between Windows and WSL paths. To align the mount point structure, change the root mount location to `/` by editing `/etc/wsl.conf` inside WSL:

```conf
[automount]
enabled = true
mountFsTab = false
root = /
options = "metadata,umask=22,fmask=11"
```

Then restart WSL from Windows:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

Launch WSL again afterward.

## 3. Working with Paths

After the mount configuration change:

- in WSL, a Windows path looks like: `/c/Users/your_name/Desktop`;
- in Windows, the same path is: `C:\Users\your_name\Desktop`.

To convert between formats, one can use the wslpath utility:

```bash
wslpath -u 'C:\Users\your_name\Desktop' # to Unix format, results in:
                                        # /c/Users/your_name/Desktop
wslpath -w /c/Users/your_name/Desktop   # to Windows format, results in:
                                        # C:\Users\your_name\Desktop
wslpath -m /c/Users/your_name/Desktop   # to Windows format with '/' as
                                        # delimiter, results in:
                                        # C:/Users/your_name/Desktop
```

## 4. Synthesis and Simulation

Follow the rest of the [tool configuration guide](https://pulp-platform.github.io/cheshire/gs/#tool-paths) as usual. However, if you are performing synthesis with Vivado installed on Windows, you [need to define](https://pulp-platform.github.io/cheshire/tg/xilinx/) the `VIVADO` environment variable using cmd.exe:

```bash
# Example:
export VIVADO="cmd.exe /c/Xilinx/Vivado/2023.1/bin/vivado.bat"
```

### Tested Targets

- `make all`
- `make chs-xilinx-vcu128` â€” Synthesis via Vivado on Windows (called from WSL)

### QuestaSim Simulation

QuestaSim (Windows version) works when launched via WSL using the `.exe` suffix:

```bash
vsim.exe
```

You can run Windows GUI and console applications from within WSL without issues (via `-gui` and `-batch` flags respectively).
